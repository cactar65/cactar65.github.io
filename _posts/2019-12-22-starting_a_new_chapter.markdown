Before I started this bootcamp with Flatiron school's I was working in I.T. for Chipotle. I had been working in the I.T. field since I had left highschool. I started coding in my free time and knew it was something I really enjoyed. Since I started as a freelance I.T consultant I worked with a lot of different companies and started meeting people who were software engineers. After speaking with them it always seemed like I wouldn't be to get a job as a software engineer without a formal degree. It didn't discorage me from pursing it on my own time.

Going from w3schools creating basic html pages with maybe inline CSS. To using sql and javascript to make flash games with simple database were my first progression into the basic's. I dont any of these projects around anymore sadly. I took that drive to hosting game servers for garry's mod and counter strike source. Learning how to make in game custom menus and connecting them to sql servers for players to track their stats. Through those couple years and experiences I came to terms with my passion for programming. 

I wanted to learn how to create applicaitons for desktop use. So I decided to dive right in with C++. Later i realized that was a probably a mistake. It did help me learn very early on (in my coding life) to not get stuck on something for too long. Going through a couple of text books I had bought about C++ 11 empowered me to make couple desktop application that generally ended up with some type of small memory loop that I couldn't seem to figure out.

Moving on from that I tried my hands in game devolepment. My first attempt was through Cryengine since it was built through C++ and had easy level editor I figured I would have a easy time getting the hang of it. Well the level editior is probably my favorite of all the game engines ive used at this point, but thats as far as I got. I had heard about udemy and I bought a couple courses about game devolpment with C# in Unity. After some time spent with that I had solid understanding with C# and 2d game development.

In my professional career I had moved from Independent contracting to working for bob evans IT, Then wendy's, and finally Chipotle. While I was at chipotle I started talking with the software devolpment team. I realized that after my 8 years in the I.T. field that I needed to make a change to be in software engineering. So after looking around at my opitions of either going back to school, a bootcamp, and trying to do it on my own. I end up choosing flatiron school. I knew it was change that had to make because I dreaded the idea of going to work every day.
